## üí° Suggested Improvements

### Implemented Features:
‚úÖ **Year range flexibility**: Offers results from other years when year filter yields no results
‚úÖ **Partial match suggestions**: "Did you mean [similar title]?" using fuzzy matching
‚úÖ **Release date context**: "That hasn't been released yet. Would you like to request it anyway?"

### Potential Future Enhancements:
1. **More specific connection errors**: Distinguish between timeout, DNS failure, and refused connection
2. **Quality preferences**: Allow users to specify 4K, HD, etc.
3. **Request status check**: "What's the status of my request for [title]?"
4. **Cancel request**: "Cancel my request for [title]"
5. **Watchlist management**: "Add [title] to my watchlist"
6. **Recent additions**: "What's new in my library?"

### Tone Adjustments:
- Consider making error messages less apologetic for issues outside user control
- Add enthusiasm to successful requests: "Great choice!" or "You got it!"
- Provide more actionable next steps in error messages

## üîß Technical Notes

### Voice Optimization Tips:
1. **Brevity**: Voice users have limited attention - keep messages under 2-3 sentences
2. **Natural speech**: Use contractions (I've, that's, you're) for more natural delivery
3. **Clear questions**: End prompts with clear yes/no questions when possible
4. **Avoid jargon**: Don't mention "media ID", "TMDB", "API", etc. to users
5. **Positive framing**: Focus on what can be done rather than what can't

### SSML Opportunities:
Consider adding SSML tags for better voice delivery:
- `<emphasis>` for title names
- `<break time="500ms"/>` after presenting information
- `<prosody rate="medium">` for consistent pacing
